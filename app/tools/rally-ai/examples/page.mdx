# Rally AI – End-to-End Example

**From New Idea → Studio → Edge → Summit**

This document walks through a concrete, end-to-end example of how **Rally AI** supports a new idea across all three AICodeRally tiers using the 3–6–∞ Framework.

**Example:** After-School STEM Club Manager

---

## 1. Idea Overview – "After-School STEM Club Manager"

**Concept:**
A digital system that helps schools or community centers run after-school STEM clubs:

- Manage students and parents
- Schedule sessions
- Track attendance
- Share resources
- Collect feedback

**Evolution Path:**

- **Studio:** Single-club management app
- **Edge:** Full program management platform (multiple clubs, schools)
- **Summit:** District-wide or multi-organization system

---

## 2. Stage 1 – Studio (Creator AI – 3 Steps)

### Tier: Studio (App Layer)
**Methodology:** 3 Steps — Ideate → Create → Validate

### 2.1 Ideate

**Goal:** Turn the raw idea into a clear app concept.

**Creator AI helps the user:**

**Clarify the problem:**
- "STEM clubs are hard to coordinate; spreadsheets and email chains are messy."

**Identify users:**
- Club organizers
- Students
- Parents
- School admins

**Define outcomes:**
- Easier scheduling
- Clear communication
- Attendance visibility
- Simple resource sharing

**Creator AI uses:**

- **Studio App Template** from the Prompt Library
- **RAG access** to:
  - Architecture 3.0 docs
  - 3–6–∞ framework
  - Existing modules (events, contacts, messaging)

**Result:**

A `studio-stem-club-planner` app spec:
- **id:** `studio-stem-club-planner`
- **domain:** `education`
- **modules:** `events-management`, `contacts`, `projects`

---

### 2.2 Create

**Goal:** Produce an actual working Studio app.

**Creator AI generates:**

**File structure:**
```
apps/studio/app/apps/stem-club-planner/page.tsx
```

**Metadata registration:**
```typescript
// apps/studio/lib/apps.ts
{
  id: "studio-stem-club-planner",
  slug: "stem-club-planner",
  name: "STEM Club Planner",
  description: "Plan and manage after-school STEM clubs.",
  domain: "education",
  primaryModules: ["events-management", "contacts", "projects"]
}
```

**Uses relevant modules:**
- `events-management` for sessions
- `contacts` for students/parents
- `projects` for projects or units

**Builds a simple UI:**
- Create sessions
- Assign participants
- Track attendance
- View basic stats

**The app is lightweight and follows Studio layering rules.**

---

### 2.3 Validate

**Goal:** Confirm the app actually solves a real problem.

**Creator AI assists in:**

**Creating a validation checklist:**
- ✓ Can organizers add sessions easily?
- ✓ Can they see who's registered?
- ✓ Can they mark attendance?
- ✓ Can they see basic stats (sessions, active students)?

**Suggesting user tests:**
- "Run this with 1–2 real clubs for 2–4 weeks."

**Capturing feedback:**
- Validation notes within the app
- Separate Studio "validation" artifact

**At the end of Studio:**

✅ The "STEM Club Planner" app exists as a Studio app
✅ Early usage and feedback indicate readiness for Edge

---

## 3. Stage 2 – Edge (Operator AI – 6 P's)

### Tier: Edge (Business Layer)
**Methodology:** 6 P's — People, Process, Products, Performance, Pipeline, Platform

If the idea proves out at Studio, the next step is to **turn it into a business OS**.

**Scenario:** A small edu-consulting org or school district wants to run STEM clubs across multiple schools.

### Operator AI maps the solution onto the 6 P's:

### P1 — People

**Who's involved:**
- Organizers, admins, teachers, volunteers
- Students, parents
- School administrators

**Roles and permissions:**
- Club organizer (create/edit sessions)
- Teacher (view/assist)
- Parent (view child's participation)
- Admin (oversight, reporting)

---

### P2 — Process

**Operational workflows:**
- Program setup (who runs what, where, when)
- Session scheduling
- Enrollment and attendance
- Feedback loops

**Example workflow:**
1. Create club program
2. Schedule sessions
3. Enroll students
4. Track attendance
5. Collect feedback
6. Report outcomes

---

### P3 — Products/Programs

**What's delivered:**
- Different club types (Robotics, Coding, Science Lab)
- Program packages (8-week term, ongoing, seasonal)

**Standardization:**
- Club templates
- Session formats
- Resource libraries

---

### P4 — Performance

**KPIs and analytics:**

**Lifecycle management:**
- Awareness → Interest → Enrollment → Participation → Completion

---

### P6 — Platform

**Enabling tools:**
- Email notifications
- Calendar integration
- Payment integration (if applicable)
- Data export/reporting
- Parent portal

**Integrations:**

---

### Edge Solution Creation

**Operator AI proposes:**

**Edge solution:** `edge-stem-program-os`

**Configuration:**
```typescript
{
  id: "edge-stem-program-os",
  label: "STEM Program OS",
  domain: "education",
  summary: "Complete operating system for after-school STEM programs",
  idealCustomerProfile: "Schools, districts, and edu orgs running enrichment programs",
  moduleIds: [
    "events-management",
    "contacts",
    "projects",
    "impact-analytics",
    "email-marketing"
  ],
  workflows: [
    {
      id: "program-creation",
      label: "Create New Program",
      mappedPillars: ["Process", "Products"]
    },
    {
      id: "session-management",
      label: "Manage Sessions",
      mappedPillars: ["Process", "Platform"]
    },
    {
      id: "attendance-tracking",
      label: "Track Attendance",
      mappedPillars: ["People", "Performance"]
    },
    {
      id: "reporting",
      label: "Generate Reports",
      mappedPillars: ["Performance", "Platform"]
    }
  ]
}
```

**This Edge solution gets registered and surfaced in the Edge portal as a vertical OS for after-school STEM programs.**
