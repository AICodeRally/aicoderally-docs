## Phase 1: Environment Setup (5 minutes)

### Prerequisites
You need:
- **Git** - [Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- **Node.js 18+** - [Download](https://nodejs.org/)
- **pnpm** - `npm install -g pnpm`
- **Code editor** - VS Code, Zed, or similar
- **Vercel account** - [Sign up free](https://vercel.com)

### Verify Installation

```bash
# Check versions (run in terminal)
node --version      # Should be v18.0.0 or higher
pnpm --version      # Should be v8.0.0 or higher
git --version       # Should be 2.30.0 or higher
```

✅ **You're ready if all three show versions!**

---

## Phase 2: Clone & Install (5 minutes)

### Clone Repository

```bash
# Navigate to where you want the project
cd ~/dev

# Clone the AICodeRally stack
git clone https://github.com/AICodeRally/aicoderally-stack.git
cd aicoderally-stack

# Check you're on main branch
git branch    # Should show main with *
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install all packages (includes all 3 apps)
pnpm install

# This installs:
# - Studio (app/studio)
# - Edge (app/edge)
# - Summit (app/summit)
# - Shared packages (packages/*)
# Takes 2-3 minutes
```

### Set Up Environment Variables

```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Open .env in your editor and add:
# 1. DATABASE_URL (get from Vercel PostgreSQL)
# 2. NEXTAUTH_SECRET (generate: openssl rand -base64 32)
# 3. ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (from Anthropic Console)

# For now, just set these required ones:
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-random-secret-here"
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-your-key-here"
```

### Test Installation

```bash
# Start dev servers
pnpm dev

# You should see:
# Studio running at: http://localhost:3000
# Edge running at: http://localhost:3001
# Summit running at: http://localhost:3002

# Press Ctrl+C to stop
```

✅ **You're done if all 3 apps start without errors!**

---

## Phase 3: Understanding Architecture (15 minutes)

### The 4-Layer System

AICodeRally uses a 4-layer architecture. Understanding this is key:

```
Layer 1: Modules (130+ reusable building blocks)
   ↓
Layer 2: Ideation Studio (Build custom AI apps)
   ↓
Layer 3: Edge Portal (Deploy to production)
   ↓
Layer 4: Summit Solutions (Enterprise solutions)
```

### What Each Layer Does

**Layer 1: Modules**
- Reusable components (buttons, forms, layouts)
- Pre-built features (AI chat, payments, auth)
- Think: LEGO bricks

```bash
# View modules
ls apps/studio/modules/
# You'll see ~130 folders like:
# - chat-interface/
# - payment-processor/
# - analytics-dashboard/
# etc.
```

**Layer 2: Studio**
- Drag-and-drop app builder
- Compose modules into apps
- Think: Assembling LEGO into something cool

```bash
# Studio source code
ls apps/studio/
# Components, pages, API routes, hooks
```

**Layer 3: Edge**
- Deploy Studio apps to production
- Handle user authentication
- Manage data and API access
- Think: Running your LEGO creation

```bash
# Edge source code
ls apps/edge/
# Production app infrastructure
```

**Layer 4: Summit**
- Enterprise multi-tenant solutions
- Advanced features, analytics, governance
- Think: Managing hundreds of LEGO creations

### Your First Understanding Task

```bash
# 1. Look at a real module
cat apps/studio/modules/ai-chat/index.ts

# 2. See what it exports
# You'll see: components, hooks, types

# 3. Find where it's used
grep -r "ai-chat" apps/studio/

# 4. Look at the Studio app structure
ls apps/studio/app/
# You'll see: layout, pages, components, api
```

**Key Concept**: Everything is modular. Each module is independent and reusable.

### Quick Architecture Check

Answer these to verify understanding:
- Q: What's a module? A: Reusable component with UI + logic
- Q: What's Studio? A: App builder where you use modules
- Q: What's Edge? A: Production deployment of Studio apps
- Q: What's Summit? A: Enterprise multi-tenant platform

✅ **You understand the architecture if you can answer all 4!**

---

## Phase 4: Make First API Call (10 minutes)

### Understanding the API

AICodeRally provides APIs for:
- **AI features** - Chat, business models, roadmaps
- **Data operations** - CRUD on any data
- **Authentication** - User sessions and identity
- **Collaboration** - Comments, threads, discussions

### Make Your First Call

**Using Postman (Recommended)**

```bash
# 1. Download Postman
# Visit: https://www.postman.com/downloads/

# 2. Import the collection
# In Postman: Click Import → Link tab
# Paste: https://docs.aicoderally.com/postman-collection.json
# Click Import

# 3. Configure environment
# Select: AICodeRally Dev
# Set base_url: http://localhost:3001
# Set auth_token: leave blank for now

# 4. Make your first request
# Go to: Collections → Authentication → Get Session
# Click Send
# You'll see your user info!
```

**Using cURL (If you prefer terminal)**

```bash
# Start dev servers first
pnpm dev

# Then in another terminal:
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/auth/session \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"

# You'll get back JSON with user info
```

**Using fetch in JavaScript**

```javascript
// Open browser console (F12) while dev server is running
// Then paste:

fetch('http://localhost:3001/api/auth/session')
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => console.log('User:', data))
  .catch(err => console.error('Error:', err))
```

### Next: Try the AI Chat API

```bash
# In Postman:
# Collections → Studio APIs → AI Chat → POST - Chat with AI

# Modify body:
{
  "message": "What is AICodeRally?",
  "context": "Developer onboarding"
}

# Click Send
# You'll get an AI response!
```

### Understanding the Response

```json
{
  "reply": "AICodeRally is...",
  "usage": {
    "input_tokens": 45,
    "output_tokens": 120
  },
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5"
}
```

**Key fields**:
- `reply` - The AI's answer
- `usage` - How many tokens (units of text)
- `model` - Which AI model was used

✅ **You're done if you got a response from the AI!**

---

## Phase 5: Deploy First Feature (20 minutes)

### Create a Simple Feature

We'll add a simple "Hello World" page to Studio app.

**Step 1: Create a new page**

```bash
# Navigate to Studio app
cd apps/studio/app

# Create hello directory
mkdir hello

# Create page file
touch hello/page.tsx
```

**Step 2: Write the page**

```typescript
// apps/studio/app/hello/page.tsx
export default function HelloPage() {
  return (
    <div style={{ padding: '2rem' }}>
      <h1>Hello, AICodeRally! 👋</h1>
      <p>I just deployed my first feature!</p>
      <button
        onClick={() => alert('Feature works!')}
        style={{
          padding: '0.5rem 1rem',
          backgroundColor: '#007bff',
          color: 'white',
          border: 'none',
          borderRadius: '4px',
          cursor: 'pointer'
        }}
      >
        Click Me
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

**Step 3: View locally**

```bash
# Make sure dev server is running
pnpm dev

# Visit: http://localhost:3000/hello
# You should see your page!
```

### Deploy to Vercel

**Step 1: Connect to GitHub**

```bash
# Make sure you're in the repo root
cd ~/dev/aicoderally-stack

# Check git status
git status

# Should show your new file:
# Untracked files:
#   apps/studio/app/hello/page.tsx
```

**Step 2: Commit your changes**

```bash
# Stage the file
git add apps/studio/app/hello/page.tsx

# Commit it
git commit -m "feat: Add hello world feature for onboarding"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

**Step 3: Deploy with Vercel**

```bash
# Option A: Using CLI (quick)
npm i -g vercel
vercel

# Option B: Using Dashboard (slower but visual)
# 1. Go to https://vercel.com
# 2. Connect your GitHub account
# 3. Select aicoderally-stack repo
# 4. Click Import
# 5. Configure environment variables
# 6. Click Deploy
```

**Step 4: See your deployed feature**

```bash
# After deployment completes, Vercel shows URL
# Example: https://aicoderally-stack.vercel.app/hello

# Open that URL in your browser
# You should see your Hello World page!
```

### Verify Deployment

```bash
# Check your deployment status
git log --oneline -5

# You should see your commit:
# a1b2c3d feat: Add hello world feature for onboarding
# main → origin/main (pushed!)

# Vercel auto-deploys your feature
# Takes 1-2 minutes
```

✅ **You deployed your first feature if it's live online!**
