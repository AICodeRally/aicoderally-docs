### [Security Checklist](/security/checklist)
Pre-deployment security validation checklist.

**Includes:**
- Code security review

## Key Security Practices

### Authentication
- ✅ NextAuth v5 for all user authentication
- ✅ Google and Apple OAuth providers
- ✅ Secure session management
- ✅ API route protection

### Data Protection
- ✅ Environment-based database isolation
- ✅ Production data never exposed to dev/preview
- ✅ Encrypted connections (SSL/TLS)
- ✅ Database credentials in Vercel secrets

### API Security
- ✅ Server-side validation for all inputs
- ✅ Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
- ✅ CORS configuration
- ✅ No exposed internal APIs

### Secret Management
- ✅ All secrets in Vercel environment variables
- ✅ Never commit `.env` files
- ✅ Rotate API keys regularly
- ✅ Production secrets separate from dev
