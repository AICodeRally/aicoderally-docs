# Architecture 3.0 – Audit Checklist

**Purpose:**
This checklist is used to confirm that the AICodeRally stack remains aligned with Architecture 3.0, the 3–6–∞ framework, and the naming/registry rules.

**Run this whenever:**
- A major feature is introduced
- A new portal or solution is added
- Before a big release or demo

---

## 1. Repository & Structure

- [ ] Primary monorepo is `aicoderally-stack` (or current canonical name)
- [ ] Four main apps exist under `apps/`:
  - [ ] `apps/website`
  - [ ] `apps/studio`
  - [ ] `apps/edge`
  - [ ] `apps/summit`
- [ ] Shared packages exist under `packages/`:
  - [ ] `packages/modules`
  - [ ] `packages/solutions-edge`
  - [ ] `packages/solutions-summit`
  - [ ] `packages/ui`
  - [ ] `packages/connectors`

**No additional "parallel architectures"** (like duplicate apps or alt module folders) have been introduced.

---

## 2. Naming & Registries

### 2.1 Modules

- [ ] All modules live in `packages/modules/*`
- [ ] All module IDs are kebab-case without tier prefixes:
  - ✅ `donor-management`, `grant-tracking`
  - ❌ `studio-donor-management`, `edge-donor-module`
- [ ] `packages/modules/src/index.ts`:
  - [ ] Exports `allModules: RallyModule[]`
  - [ ] Exports `modulesById: Map<string, RallyModule>`

### 2.2 Studio Apps

- [ ] All Studio apps live under `apps/studio/app/apps/*`
- [ ] All Studio IDs start with `studio-`:
  - e.g. `studio-taco-scope`, `studio-pta-fundraiser`
- [ ] `apps/studio/lib/apps.ts`:
  - [ ] Contains `StudioAppMeta[]`
  - [ ] Provides getters by `id`/`slug`

### 2.3 Edge Solutions

- [ ] Edge solutions defined under `packages/solutions-edge/src/*`
- [ ] All Edge solution IDs start with `edge-`:
  - e.g. `edge-npedge`, `edge-bhgedge`, `edge-designer-biz-kit`
- [ ] `packages/solutions-edge/src/index.ts` exports:
  - [ ] `edgeSolutions: RallySolution[]`
  - [ ] `getEdgeSolutionById(id)`

### 2.4 Summit Solutions

- [ ] Summit solutions defined under `packages/solutions-summit/src/*`
- [ ] All Summit solution IDs start with `summit-`:
  - e.g. `summit-spm-governance`
- [ ] `packages/solutions-summit/src/index.ts` exports:
  - [ ] `summitSolutions: RallySolution[]`
  - [ ] `getSummitSolutionById(id)`

---

## 3. Tier Responsibilities (Studio / Edge / Summit)

### 3.1 Studio – App Layer (3 Steps)

- [ ] Studio is only used for **individual apps**, not full businesses
- [ ] Studio UI and copy are framed as:
  - Ideate → Create → Validate
- [ ] No business OS concerns in Studio (no global CRM, billing, or multi-app orchestration)
- [ ] Taco apps (scope, business case, finder) remain separate Studio apps

### 3.2 Edge – Business Layer (6 P's)

- [ ] Edge pages, docs, and solutions follow the 6 P's:
  - People, Process, Products/Programs, Performance, Pipeline, Platform
- [ ] Edge solutions (npEdge, bhgEdge, Designer Biz Kit, Brand Hub, etc.) clearly map onto the 6 P's in their docs/UI
- [ ] Edge does **not** define new modules inside `apps/edge` — capabilities still live in `packages/modules`

### 3.3 Summit – Enterprise Layer (∞ Extensions)

- [ ] Summit pages and docs define Summit as the enterprise/orchestration layer
- [ ] Summit solutions emphasize:
  - Governance, Scale, Integration, Intelligence, Strategy, Change
- [ ] Summit builds on modules + Edge solutions; no duplicate capability layer is created

---

## 4. Design System Compliance

- [ ] Tailwind CSS is used throughout; no random CSS files creeping in
- [ ] Font: Inter for all UI surfaces
- [ ] Icons use the approved library (Radix UI icons or the chosen standard; no reintroduction of random sets)
- [ ] Tier visual identity:
  - [ ] Studio: cyan → teal → emerald, rounded-xl
  - [ ] Edge: orange → rose → pink, rounded-lg
  - [ ] Summit: violet → fuchsia → yellow, rounded-md
- [ ] No emojis used as UI icons
- [ ] Sloth branding appears only where intended (hero, tier pages, about, franchise), not in core Edge/Summit production UI

---

## 5. Prompt Library & AI Integration

- [ ] `knowledge/prompt-library/` exists with templates for:
  - [ ] Studio app
  - [ ] Edge solution
  - [ ] Summit solution
  - [ ] Module
  - [ ] (Optional) Showcase entry
- [ ] `.ai/PROMPT_LIBRARY.md` exists and instructs agents to use these templates
- [ ] `.ai/SYSTEM.md` references the Prompt Library as mandatory

---

## 6. Validation & CI

- [ ] `pnpm aicr:validate` runs locally without unexpected errors
- [ ] GitHub Action exists (e.g. `.github/workflows/validate-architecture.yml`) to run validation on PRs against main/master
- [ ] New modules/solutions/apps do not bypass validation

---

## 7. Website & Showcase

- [ ] Homepage includes a "3–6–∞ Framework" section
- [ ] Tier pages:
  - [ ] Studio → 3-step story
  - [ ] Edge → 6 P's story
  - [ ] Summit → ∞ extensions story
- [ ] Showcase:
  - [ ] Lists graduates (TacoFinder, etc.)
  - [ ] Uses Studio/Edge/Summit framing in "How This Was Built"
- [ ] No raw module names are surfaced as first-class user concepts

---

**If all boxes are checked and `pnpm aicr:validate` passes, Architecture 3.0 is considered clean and intact.**
