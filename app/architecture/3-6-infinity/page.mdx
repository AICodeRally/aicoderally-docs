# AICodeRally 3–6–∞ Framework

The AICodeRally 3–6–∞ Framework describes how **ideas become apps**, how **apps become businesses**, and how **businesses scale into enterprise systems**.

- **3** – Studio app lifecycle (Ideate → Create → Validate)
- **6** – Edge business operating model (the 6 P's)
- **∞** – Summit enterprise orchestration extensions

---

## 1. Studio – 3 Steps (App Layer)

**Goal:** Take one idea and turn it into a working, validated app.

Studio follows a light, fast loop:

### 1. Ideate
- Define problem, users, and value.
- Identify what "success" looks like for the app.

### 2. Create
- Build the app: UI, flows, basic data structures.
- Example artifacts:
  - Scope app (requirements and constraints)
  - Prototype app (interactive experience)

### 3. Validate
- Test with users or stakeholders.
- Collect feedback and refine.
- Decide whether to iterate, park, or promote to Edge.

**Studio outputs apps, not operating models.**

### Examples

- **Taco Scope, Taco Business Case, TacoFinder** - Complete app creation cycle
- **PTA Fundraiser** - Event planning and donation tracking
- **Birthday Planner** - Party planning and invitation management
- **Startup Forge** - Business ideation and validation
- **Future Builders** - Youth career exploration

---

## 2. Edge – The 6 P's (Business Layer)

**Goal:** Turn apps into a functioning business operating system.

Edge implements the AICodeRally Edge Operating Model (EOM), based on six universal pillars:

### 1. People
- Roles, teams, collaborators, customers, volunteers.
- Permissions and access boundaries.
- **Example:** Staff directory, role management, volunteer coordination

### 2. Process
- Operational workflows and task flows.
- How work is requested, executed, reviewed, and completed.
- **Example:** Service delivery workflows, approval processes, task management

### 3. Products / Programs / Offers
- What the organization delivers: services, programs, engagement types, packages.
- Standardization and repeatability for each offering.
- **Example:** Service catalog, program definitions, package pricing

### 4. Performance
- KPIs, dashboards, and analytics.
- How leadership sees progress, health, and impact.
- **Example:** Impact dashboards, financial reports, donor analytics

### 5. Pipeline
- Leads, donors, clients, opportunities.
- Lifecycle from awareness to engagement to retention.
- **Example:** Donor pipeline, client acquisition, volunteer recruitment

### 6. Platform
- Enabling tools: CRM, billing, communication, scheduling, automation.
- Integrations, workflows, and glue systems.
- **Example:** Email automation, calendar sync, payment processing

### Edge Solutions

**Edge solutions** (like npEdge, Designer Biz Kit, Brand Hub, BHG Edge) are **vertical implementations** of the 6 P's.

- **npEdge** - Nonprofit operating system (donors, programs, impact tracking)
- **Designer Biz Kit** - Creative studio operations (clients, projects, billing)
- **Brand Hub** - Brand and marketing operations (campaigns, assets, analytics)
- **BHG Edge** - SPM practice management (clients, engagements, governance)

**Edge outputs a Business OS.**

---

## 3. Summit – ∞ Extensions (Enterprise Layer)

**Goal:** Orchestrate multiple businesses, systems, and data sources at an enterprise level.

Summit builds on the 6 P's but extends them with enterprise-grade concerns ("Summit Zones"):

### 1. Governance
- Policies, approvals, compliance, versioning, risk.
- **Example:** Multi-entity approval workflows, compliance tracking, audit trails

### 2. Scale
- Multi-team, multi-unit, multi-region structures.
- Rollouts across departments or geographies.
- **Example:** Regional franchises, department hierarchies, multi-brand portfolios

### 3. Integration
- Cross-system data flows, API meshes, unified models.
- Linking AICodeRally with ERPs, CRMs, HRIS, and more.
- **Example:** ERP integration, unified customer data platform, API orchestration

### 4. Intelligence
- AI agents, automation, predictive models.
- Guardrails and oversight for automated decisions.
- **Example:** Predictive analytics, AI-powered recommendations, automated workflows

### 5. Strategy
- Enterprise performance, OKRs, transformation programs.
- Alignment between exec goals and ground reality.
- **Example:** Executive dashboards, strategic planning, transformation roadmaps

### 6. Change
- Rollout planning, training, adoption, feedback loops.
- **Example:** Change management programs, training curricula, adoption metrics

### Summit Solutions

**Summit solutions** (e.g., Summit SPM Governance) treat Edge solutions and modules as **building blocks** and add enterprise orchestration on top.

- **Summit SPM Governance** - Multi-practice SPM governance and compliance

**Summit outputs Enterprise Orchestration.**

## 4. How the Layers Relate

### Studio → App
- One idea becomes one app.
- Fast, iterative, low overhead.
- **Timeline:** Days to weeks

### Edge → Business
- One or more apps become a business operating system.
- Structured around the 6 P's.
- **Timeline:** Weeks to months

### Summit → Enterprise
- Multiple Edge systems and data sources are orchestrated.
- Governed, integrated, and scaled.
- **Timeline:** Months to years

### Example: TacoFinder Journey

**Studio Phase:**
- **Taco Scope** - Define the problem (taco discovery)
- **Taco Business Case** - Validate market opportunity
- **TacoFinder Prototype** - Build consumer app MVP

**Edge Phase (Future):**
- **TacoEdge** - Operator OS for taquerias
  - People: Staff, shifts, vendors
  - Process: Order fulfillment, inventory management
  - Products: Menu items, specials, catering packages
  - Performance: Sales analytics, customer satisfaction
  - Pipeline: Customer acquisition, loyalty programs
  - Platform: POS integration, delivery apps, marketing tools

**Summit Phase (Future):**
- **Multi-City Taco Ecosystem**
  - Governance: Brand standards, franchise compliance
  - Scale: Multi-location operations, regional management
  - Integration: Unified ordering, supply chain orchestration
  - Intelligence: Demand forecasting, menu optimization
  - Strategy: Market expansion, franchise growth
  - Change: Training programs, rollout management

## 5. Why This Framework Matters

✅ **Aligns technical architecture with business reality.**
✅ **Keeps roles clear:**
- Studio for app creation.
- Edge for business operations.
- Summit for enterprise orchestration.

✅ **Provides a consulting-grade narrative** for clients, partners, and internal teams.
✅ **Forms the backbone** for Edge/Summit solutions, Showcase storytelling, and franchise training.

## 6. Application in Practice

### For Developers

Use this framework to understand **where your work lives**:

- **Studio apps** should not become business OS components.
- **Edge solutions** should not duplicate modules.
- **Summit solutions** should not reimplement Edge logic.

**Example Decision Tree:**
```
Is this a single-purpose app?
  → YES: Studio (e.g., studio-taco-scope)
  → NO: Continue

Does it manage business operations?
  → YES: Edge (e.g., edge-npedge)
  → NO: Continue

Does it orchestrate multiple businesses?
  → YES: Summit (e.g., summit-spm-governance)
```

### For Product/Strategy

Use this to **position offerings** to different customer segments:

- **Studio:** Community, youth, creators
  - Pricing: Free or low-cost
  - Support: Self-service, community
  - Complexity: Low

- **Edge:** SMBs, nonprofits, agencies
  - Pricing: Monthly subscription
  - Support: Onboarding, email/chat
  - Complexity: Medium

- **Summit:** Enterprises, multi-unit organizations
  - Pricing: Enterprise contracts
  - Support: Dedicated CSM, custom implementation
  - Complexity: High

### For AI Agents

When creating new artifacts, **respect tier boundaries**:

- **Studio:** `studio-*` IDs, 3-step methodology
- **Edge:** `edge-*` IDs, 6 P's framework
- **Summit:** `summit-*` IDs, ∞ extensions

**Do not mix tier concerns** (e.g., governance logic in Studio).
